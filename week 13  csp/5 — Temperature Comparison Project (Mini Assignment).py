# Objective:
# Apply comparison and logical operators to a real-world problem.

# Scenario:
# Write a program that:

# Asks the user for today’s temperature.

# Prints whether it’s cold, warm, or hot using comparison operators.

# If the temperature is out of range (below -10 or above 110), display “Extreme temperature warning!”

# Starter Code:

temperature = float(input("what is todays temperature: "))


if temperature < -10 or temperature > 110:
    print("dangerous weather")
else:

    if temperature < 40:
        print("It's cold.")
    elif temperature > 40:
        print("It's warm.")
    else:
        print("It's hot.")
